# High-Energy-Particle-Physics-with-ROOT
High Energy particle physics data analysis with ROOT, the software of choice at the LHC. Project involves reconstructing the Higgs mass from LHC collision data. This work was done for my particle physics class under the supervision of Professor Jeffrey Richman and TA Alex Dorsett.
